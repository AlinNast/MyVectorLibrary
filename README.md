# MyVectorLibrary

This library provides an implementation of 3D / 4D Vectors and  4x4 Matrices 

It comes with Overriden operators to make it work nicely when its added in any code, also header only file. 

Vector operations: 
Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and dot products. also cross product for 3D

Matrix operations:
Translation, Scaling, and Rotation (X, Y, Z).
Matrix-Matrix and Matrix-Vector multiplication.
Full implementation of Matrix Transpose.
Matrix Inversion using the Adjugate method (Cofactor expansion).
Determinant calculation for 4x4 matrices.


Simply include the header file into your code to make it work
